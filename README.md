### Hi there, I'm Virendra ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a passionate entrepreneur and technology leader who turns complex challenges into opportunities for groundbreaking innovation. My career has been built on a hands-on, first-principles approach, whether it was co-founding a DevOps consultancy that reached Â£2M ARR or leading multi-disciplinary engineering teams to develop secure, scalable platforms.

Today, Iâ€™m channelling my expertise into two dynamic ventures:

- **Co-Founder & CTO** at [Novathes](https://novathes.com/): Here, weâ€™re revolutionizing healthcare through AI-driven innovation, creating solutions that transform patient care and push the boundaries of what's possible.

- **Head of DevOps & Platform Engineering** at [IU Group](https://www.iu-group.com/): Iâ€™m crafting a future-proof platform strategy with one clear vision: making education accessible to everyone.

I thrive on aligning technical solutions with strategic business goals and nurturing high-performing teams that drive sustainable change. Passionate about healthcare, sustainability, and the arts, Iâ€™m committed to using technology for positive impact.
