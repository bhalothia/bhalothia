### Hi there, I'm Virendra 👋

I'm a Systems Engineer based out of Germany. I have over a decade of experience working on various phases of SDLC and most prominently in treating Infrastructure as Code and Site Reliability Operations. 

- 👷 I’m currently working on scaling [Sennder](https://www.sennder.com/)'s Infrastructure to meet exponential business growth.

- 👯 I would be happy to collaborate on Container Technologies, Policy Driven Infrastructure, Observability, consensus mechanisms for blockchains (to name a few).
