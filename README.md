### Hi there, I'm Virendra 👋

I’m a passionate entrepreneur and technology leader who turns complex challenges into opportunities for groundbreaking innovation. My career has been built on a hands-on, first-principles approach, whether it was co-founding a DevOps consultancy that reached £2M ARR or leading multi-disciplinary engineering teams to develop secure, scalable platforms.

Today, I’m channelling my expertise into two dynamic ventures:

- **Head of DevOps & Platform Engineering** at [IU Group](https://www.iu-group.com/): I’m crafting a future-proof platform strategy with one clear vision: making education accessible to everyone.

- **Co-Founder & CTO** at [Novathes](https://novathes.com/): Here, we’re revolutionizing healthcare through AI-driven innovation, creating solutions that transform patient care and push the boundaries of what's possible.

I thrive on aligning technical solutions with strategic business goals and nurturing high-performing teams that drive sustainable change. Passionate about healthcare, sustainability, and the arts, I’m committed to using technology for positive impact.
